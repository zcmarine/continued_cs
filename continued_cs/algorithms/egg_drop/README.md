You have n eggs and a building with k floors. You want to find the lowest floor on which an egg will
drop. What is the fewest number of drops you can do and be sure you've found that floor?

Note that this is a generalization of the typical problem of 2 eggs and 36 (or 100) floors, i.e.
where n=2 and k=36 (or 100).
